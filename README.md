# Intro
While at Concentrix, I coded these emails for Hyundai for their Spring 2016 QCM (Quartly Coupon Mailer).  Included are the standard eblast (English and Spanish) as well as a version for Premium customers.

## Note
Coding for email is rather tricky; I did QA using Litmus testing across approximately 40 email clients/apps on multiple devices. You will note extensive use of internal stylesheets and inline CSS.

## Features
* Responsive
* Collapsible panels/interactivity for mobile layout (where supported)

## Challenges and Solutions
Coming soon.
