# Intro
While at Concentrix, I coded these emails for Hyundai for their Spring 2016 QCM (Quartly Coupon Mailer).  Included are the standard eblast (English and Spanish) as well as a version for Premium customers. Using "variable data" provided by Hyundai, these emails are customized coupon offers to entice customers to visit their local dealership.

## Note
Coding for email is rather tricky; there are many limitations with both code and layout. I did QA using Litmus testing as well as on my own devices/email accounts to ensure code compatibility across approximately 40 email clients/apps. You will note extensive use of internal stylesheets and inline CSS.

## Features
* Responsive
* Collapsible panels/interactivity for mobile layout (where supported)

## Challenges and Solutions
Coming soon.
